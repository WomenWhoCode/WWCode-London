  <br><br>
For our July Book Club, Women Who Code London will be reading and discussing ‚ÄúQuiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking" by Susan Cain.
<br><br>

How can you measure or define someone's personality? One way is to figure out where a person falls on the introvert-extrovert spectrum. Want to know where on the spectrum you are? Come join us at the book club and see how you can learn about:

- Can one be an extroverted introvert and vice versa?
- Why do extroverts often have it easier?
- How can the particular skills of introverts and extroverts be of use to achieve excellence?
