In writing The Grit Factor, Polson made it her mission to connect with an elite pack of tough, impressive female iconoclasts who shared with her their candid stories of combat and career.

Covey | Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High discusses how to handle disagreements and high-stakes communication. It is written on the premise that when you are stuck in any situation ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs at home or work ‚Äì there is a crucial conversation keeping you from accomplishing the desired results. If you can learn to speak up in these crucial moments effectively, then you can accomplish the results you are after.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                            |

She provides a field-tested model for decoding how cultural differences impact international business, and combines a smart analytical framework with practical, actionable advice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                            |

She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts‚Äîfrom a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.                 |                                                            |

If women are nice, they are seen as weak and ineffective, but if they are tough, they are labeled a bitch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                            |
