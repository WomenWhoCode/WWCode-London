Mentorship: How to start? Practical Tips from experienced mentors:

The Panel Discussion “What makes a good mentor?” was centred around essential topics such as effective communication, establishing clear expectations, providing guidance and delivering constructive feedback. The panelists, experienced mentors and experts in their fields, shared their insights on the role of mentorship, uncovering the challenges and opportunities that come with this impactful relationship. The audience actively participated in the discussion, raising thought-provoking questions and engaging in meaningful conversations.
This event could be particularly beneficial for both first-time mentors seeking guidance to embark on their mentoring journey and experienced mentors looking to refine their approaches.
