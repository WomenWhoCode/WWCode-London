## Process

### Joining Stage

You have to [complete the form](TODO_GET_LINK) before the deadline mentioned in [event](TODO_GET_EVENT_LINK)

Pick up among:

- [Mock-Coding Interview - Algorithms & Data Structure](/resources/mock-interviews/mock-code-interview)
- [Mock-Behaviour Interview](/resources/mock-interviews/mock-behavioral-interview)

### Request Acceptance Stage

- WWCode team review forms and match candidates.
- You will receive an email with a contact of the person your matched with or information that we couldn’t find a match for you.

### Schedule Stage

Once you receive a match, you should schedule the meeting with your opponent (Google meet, zoom, etc.)

**During mock-interview, you’re playing both roles: as candidate, and as interviewer. You'll be marked as Primary or Secondary.
Primary should organise an interview.**

- Primary
  - Once a request has been accepted by the interviewer, the candidate should agree the date-time and the preferred meeting tool (zoom, google meet, webex, MS teams, etc) for the mock behvaioural interview with the interviewer.
  - Send a 30 mins meeting invite for the interview

- Secondary
  - Agree the date-time and preferred meeting tool (zoom, google meet, webex, MS teams, etc) with the candidate
  - Accept the meeting invite sent by the candidate

### Preparation Stage

- Have a look in the guidelines for [Mock-Behaviour Interview](/resources/mock-interviews/mock-behavioral-interview) and [Mock-Coding Interview - Algorithms & Data Structure](/resources/mock-interviews/mock-code-interview).
- Check the Workshops for [Behavioral Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWHQ0g8sorI) and [Mock-Interviews: Algorithms & Data Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWHQ0g8sorI)

### Is required any level of knowleadge

No, there is no restriction

### How to prepare for the mock interview?

We suggest you to whatch the [workshops](#preparation-stage).

If you want to be prepared for the Algorithms & Data Structure interview, try to do some examples from [leetcode, easy questions](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/?difficulty=EASY&page=1).
