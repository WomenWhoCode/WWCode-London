## Process

### Joining Stage

You have to [complete the form](TODO_GET_LINK) before the deadline mentioned in [event](TODO_GET_EVENT_LINK)

Pick up among:

- [Mock-Coding Interview - Algorithms & Data Structure](/resources/mock-interviews/mock-code-interview)
- [Mock-Behaviour Interview](/resources/mock-interviews/mock-behavioral-interview)

### Request Acceptance Stage

- WWCode team review forms and match candidates.
- You will receive an email with a contact of the person your matched with or information that we couldn’t find a match for you.

### Schedule Stage

Once you receive a match, you should schedule the meeting with your opponent (Google meet, zoom, etc.)

**During mock-interview, you’re playing both roles: as candidate, and as interviewer. You'll be marked as Primary or Secondary.
Primary should organise an interview.**

- Primary
  - Once a request has been accepted by the interviewer, the candidate should agree the date-time and the preferred meeting tool (zoom, google meet, webex, MS teams, etc) for the mock behvaioural interview with the interviewer.
  - Send a 30 mins meeting invite for the interview

- Secondary
  - Agree the date-time and preferred meeting tool (zoom, google meet, webex, MS teams, etc) with the candidate
  - Accept the meeting invite sent by the candidate

### Preparation Stage

- Have a look in the guidelines for [Mock-Behaviour Interview](/resources/mock-interviews/mock-behavioral-interview) and [Mock-Coding Interview - Algorithms & Data Structure](/resources/mock-interviews/mock-code-interview).
- Check the Workshops for [Behavioral Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWHQ0g8sorI) and [Mock-Interviews: Algorithms & Data Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWHQ0g8sorI)

### Feedback

## Possible Questions

### How will the match process be done?

The matches will be based on the programming language, level and the type of interview you are interested in.
Then as final factor the time availability.

### Does it require any level of knowledge or experience?

No, there is no restriction

### How to prepare for the mock interview?

We suggest you watch the [workshops](#preparation-stage).

If you want to be prepared for the Algorithms & Data Structure interview, try to do some examples from [leetcode, easy questions](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/?difficulty=EASY&page=1).
