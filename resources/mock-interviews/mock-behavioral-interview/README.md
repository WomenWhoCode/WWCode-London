# Mock Behavioral Interview

Interviewing is a skill that improves with practice. You never want your first interview to be for the job you want the most. In order to ensure you have had some practice before it really counts, Women Who Code London is proud to launch the Mock Behavioral Interview Program for all our members to hone their interviewing skills.

A mock interview gives you practice answering interview questions in a realistic setting where you are under a bit of pressure. It’s only about 30 minutes, but that’s enough time to force you to think on your feet. Most important, mock interviews are designed to provide feedback and allow for improvement.

Who is this program for?
1. Anyone who is looking for a job and wants to hone their interviewing skills by practicing in a supportive environment
2. Anyone who would be willing to help conduct interviews with candidates and provide feedback. Mock Interviews offer an excellent opportunity to highlight your commitment to the community and also train your own interviewer skills. Interviewers will be provided with full support and resources to conduct interviews and provide feedback.
