  <td align="left">One of the most crucial soft skills, both within and outside of the job, is communication. It also functions as an elixir for extremely healthy applications. There are no other roles in software engineering that are as dependent on one another as the tester and developer. Without each other, neither would be able to do their respective tasks. Although software testers and developers have a shared objective, poor communication causes them to lose sight of it and turn against one another.
<ul>
    <li>For a test engineer, what does effective communication look like?</li>
    <li>Why should test engineers practice communicating effectively?</li>
    <li>What are the dos and don'ts, advice, and techniques for managing daily tasks?</li>
</ul>

There are only general ideas and techniques to be found while searching online for articles on effective communication. In this talk, speaker will focus on the subtleties of communication barriers between testers and developers and share with you some recommendations on how to have an effective conversation.</th>
